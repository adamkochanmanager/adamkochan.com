So for some back ground this is a "different version" of an album that came out in 2020 by the same artist, NO DREAM. So this is a passion project of Jeff's as he has a major love of SKA. With that in mind what does a SKA album releases in 2021 sound like? 

It sounds absolutely amazing! Get SKA music back in the mainstream. 

In the past few years, I have found myself adding songs like "The Impression That I Get" and "Beer" to playlists kind of as a novelty but end up always have a fun time and loving the songs, so to get a new full album of SKA bangers is just great.

From top to bottom this album harkens back to my days listening to "Superman" by Goldfinger as I stumbled my way through levels on Tony Hawk Pro Skater. The tight horns, the guitar, the keys, and background "PICK IT UPS" are on point for the whole run of this album. 

There are a ton of moments where the brass section, guitars or keys just absolutely own the sound an it really took me back to my first few times I found SKA Music.

Where this album didn’t hit for me was on the more Reggae cuts of the album. SO I think my “wave” is the emphasis on the horns and the "pick it ups". That’s my wave.

Will definitely have to give the album this was original based on a listen as well, but in the meantime if you want to hear some 202’s SKA doen right you will not be disappointed with this album.
