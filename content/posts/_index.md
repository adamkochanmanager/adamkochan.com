Hey there, so I had this idea for a New Years Resolution, which is to listen to a new album every single day.

[I would suggest you start here which is my "hub" page" for January Reviews](/posts/album-a-day-jan-2022-intro)

I have a few other friends doing this as well:
- Reno is doing it over at [his own blog](www.renodubois.com)
- Robert is over [here on Notion](https://robertlandis.notion.site/)
