Coming into this album I thought I knew two things:
1. I didn’t like any hyperpop song
2. Charli XCX was a one hit wonder from "Boom Clap"

I am happy to report I was wrong on both things. "how i'm feeling now" is the 2020 release of pop star Charli XCX. I had heard good things in the past of her last albums "Pop 2" (2017) and "Charli" (2019), but have never given a full album a chance until now. And I a very happy that I gave it a chance.

This album is full in on the hyperpop sound but isn't dialed up to 11 as an "100 gecs" album is, this album spends time with processed instrumentals and chiptune vocals, but given some space to breathe and sound like a "normal" pop album. I will admit that the songs that only have slight hyperpop influence were a more enjoyable experience, but the hyperpop sound didn’t push me away as much in other artists.

The other thing to talk about is Charlie's impressive song writing. This album was written and produced at the start of the COVID pandemic and there are a lot of songs that talk about missing human connection and missing parties, hell the song "anthems" is a club banger about missing club bangers. Other songs like "forever" and "c2.0" have very clear ties to the hyperpop sound but paired with smarter production and a more palatable sound come across as highlights for me. Especially love the chopped up vocals on "c2.0" that turn into the backing beat for the second half of the song.

The albums low lights like I said above is when the hyperpopness cup runneth over. "pink diamond" is a good song, but has a grating instrumental behind it that actually sounds like, that gets annoying after the first 2 minutes.

This was a very surprising album for me and made me appreciate Charli and hyperpop a decent amount more, but I still don't think I’m ready for "stupid horse" levels of hyperpop.
