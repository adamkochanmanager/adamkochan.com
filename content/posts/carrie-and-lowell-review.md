Wow, just wow. This is an album that complete caught me off guard. I have known about Sufjan for a while, he even wrote songs for one of my favorite movies "Call Me By Your Name"! But this album stripped away everything else and just left a man with a guitar, piano, and so many emotions.

This album is about the passing of his biological mother that gave him up at "3, maybe 4" as he says in 'Should Have Known Better'. And every song is seeped in this mixture of sorrow and resentment, which is chilling.

And the way Sufjan paints these feelings is absolutely captivating. Throughout the whole album you see this man processing "in real time" all of these different feelings, from anger at his mother and himself all the way to a realization that we are all gonna die. 

In "Should of Known Better" he chastises himself for knowing how sick his mother way and instead of writing a letter or dealing with these emotions he was feeling at the time he decided to keep it bottled up. In "All of Me Wants All of You" he laments about wanting to spend more time and absolute captivated by a lover or his mother, but either way its still sticks with you. It's absolutely harrowing when the song "opens up" into this beautiful sound space as it moves into the end of the song.

There is something so moving with the way Sufjan strips back almost everything in this album and the production really centers on his voice and guitar, which are mixed absolutely heavenly together. There is a time where you start getting to the end of the album where songs can seem like they are being repeated but the lyrical contents really carry these songs.

This was such an interesting album that I don't think can be recreated, this "state" someone must be in to write an album like this doesn't come along often, and ever more so to want to "record" your therapy in something such as this is a monumental task. I applaud Sufjan and team for making an album with such complex feelings and for making me want to cry under a blanket in the middle of a Saturday Night.
