I was originally brought into this album by seeing a "nu-disco" tab on Rate Your Music and as someone who has been getting into "nu-disco" ever since Dua Lipa's Disco flavored "Future Nostalgia" I have been craving more and more.

But to be brutally honest, I was thoroughly confused by my first listen of this album. It has so many different sounds and just sounded like a wall of music that hits you with a new idea every minute.

I was about to write this review, give it a 5 and move on with my life, but I put this album on as I was coding, and it absolute changed the whole vibe.

This album sounds like the soundtrack to the best coding movie of all time, this album is the scene in "The Social Network" where Mark and Sean Parker are at the club and you just hear this killer house track in the back ground and its almost drowning out their voices.

The artist Todd Terje is a Scandinavian Dance music producer and this album is full of bop after bop that makes me want to fly to the Netherlands and just vibe out listening to this music at a club.

First thing is first the synths on almost all these songs are absolutely amazing. The songs have an amazing build and pay off, my favorite song "DeLorean Dynamite" is the best example. At the start there is a clear melody, and this melody doesn't stop but what Todd builds around it is this absolute amazing sound scape of synth and bass just crescendo’s to create a perfect pay off half way in the track and you just ride at that vibe for the rest of the track.

The only thing that wasn't great on this album (to me) was the seemly out of place "Johnny and Mary" which breaks up a killer instrumental vibe with a little bit of a vocal ballad that caught me off guard every time.

This album is pure jazzy, nu-disco fun for 40 minutes of its run time and sometimes that’s the perfect music to code to.
