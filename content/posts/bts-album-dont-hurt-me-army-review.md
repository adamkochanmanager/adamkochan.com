Over the past year I have been exposed to KPop (partially against my own will) and have really began to enjoy it, please come to my DM's and talk about TWICE. And if you are talking about KPop at some point you gotta talk about BTS.

The Boyband Super Group consiting of 7 *Wangjanims* Jin, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, Jungkook, and Suga (best boy). And this group expands the full pop soundscape, coming at you with upbeat rap songs, ballads, and abosulte bangers.

To be quite honest, I had never given a full album of BTS a chance, my only expousre has been either through their "Mainstream" hits like "Dynamite", "Butter", "Permission to Dance (Instrumental Version)" or deep cut recomendations (check out "Stigma") so this was a interesting view to see their "deeper cuts" and I was absolutely blown away.

1st off this album has a little something for everyone.

Looking for Bangers: Dope, Silver Spoon
Looking for Jams: Ma City, House of Cards
Looking for Bops: Run, I Need U

The production on this album spans so many different styles but throught out it pulls great from its Western Rap/Pop influences. Songs on here fell so alive and upbeat and just overal "fun". House of Cards felt like it could fit right along side any number of Weeknd's hits, while Silver Spoon and DOpe feel like they can go along side some of Brockhampton's "Boyband" style Rap.

Speaking of "Dope" it is absolutely the stand out track for me, an absolute Banger which has a killer Sax and has so much cockiness and bradiouscious energy as they just singing about how "Dope" they are. It has my favorite troupe of KPop Bands where they trade off the same verse, going from one interesting flow to another. This song has an infectious "Energy Energy Energy" and will have you bopping you head throughout. 

I really do hate the critism or the stigma of "well if i don't know what they say, I won't enjoy the songs." This album has so many songs where the vocal performance stands out and hits the exact energy taht they are going for, where on Butterfly you get a slowed down ballad or the "layering" of the vocals on "Epilogue: Young Forever" which give it this beutiful grandious feeling.

If you are looking to get into KPop or looking for a place to start your "army" fandom, this is a great album with a ton of stand out tracks that really play up to BTS's strength
