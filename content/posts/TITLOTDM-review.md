The first album I didnt fully connect with from this challenege so far. But it's not to say this is a "bad" album, more that I can admit this is not "my album". 

But on paper the core concept sounds like a smash hit, a trio of Sax, Drums, and Keys doing their take on "electro" Jazz. That sounds so far up my lane, its scary. But by the 6th track, I could pick up that this album was not made for how I was listening to it. 

What I mean by that is that this album puts you in a haze and just hits you with solid Sax playing with great support from the keys and synth, but I felt liek I would have had to been in another mental state to really fully enjoy this album to its absolute desgree. I would also love seeing this album in person, I just dont think it was condusive to where I was at and how I was listening to it.

I will talk very highly of the track "Summon The Fire" which feels like the best blend of their quick procussions mixed with amazing synth, with an absolute killer performance by the Sax. This track really shows the potential this group has they are all VERY talented individuals, its just the way that the this album was assembled does not play up to those strengths at least to me.

The band's playing is tight and well mixed and they span a ton of different sounds, from more Jazz flavored cuts to sounds that cross into Psychodellic Rock. But with each change I was taken back to wanting to hear more of what made "Summon the Fire" so amazinf.

I will definitely keep my eye on this band going forward, but this outing just didnt hit my fancy, BUT i can tell that they have talent.
