Well that was fun, This is like if you took LCD Soundsystem, added in some Franz Ferdinand, some Scott Pilgrim vs the World, and then gave them a Political Channel on Youtube. Which isn’t a bad thing.

I would have never listened to this Album if it wasn’t for this “challenge”. When this album works it WORKS, the instrumentation and production is stellar throughout, so many catchy grooves and cool moments. I would not consider myself a fan of punk/alt-rock but after listening to this I can see the appeal. 

There is a ton of “fun” on the Album, from calling a song “Freebird II” (If Freebird is so good why did it take so long to make Freebird II?) and to letting out a “AND FUCK TOM BRADY” on the Opener and that “fun” is infectious throughout the album. It felt like I was catching this band in the studio and they were just shredding and riffing together. It has some “DIY” vibes, but it sounds amazing. The drums and lead guitar especially stand out in some tracks like "Almost Had to Start a Fight/In And Out Of Patience" and "Wide Awake". I was nodding my head along to so many songs and on re listens I catch myself grooving a little harder every time.

Where I don’t 100% love this album is the vocal performance. I know this is a staple of punk/emo music, but I am not a fan of my take on “not good vocal, but that’s part of the charm” music and this album has some moments of that. 

The lyrics are “woke” in some instance and "broke" in others. They work really well in songs like “Before The Water Gets Too High” where they describe the current state of the world and discrepancies in the wealth gap, and in “Death Will Bring Change” which is all about how our social political “culture” wont change until the current generation dies (#RIPBoomers). But, there are also songs like “Wide Awake” which has such an amazing groove but the lyrics come across as “we are woke and we are singing how we are woke” which I am not a fan of.

Most of the time the abrasiveness, overtly politcal in your face performance works, but sometimes it rubbed me the wrong way, but hey I’m pretty sure this is exactly what a punk album is supposed to be. 

I can see screaming these lyrics with 200 other people in a dingy concert hall as a great time.
