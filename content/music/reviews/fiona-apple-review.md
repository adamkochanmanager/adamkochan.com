What an ecletic and weird album, definitely never have heard anything like this before. There is so many interesting and unique sounds in this album that it almost puts so much tenision in the lyrics as well as the instrumentation. 

Which is where I think that I will spend most of my review talking about this album has so many interesting musical movements that are driven by the choice of instruments. This album sounds like everyday noises that are turned into singer song writer songs. Fiona is seemingly using the sounds that we would hear every day to build as the basis of her album and that is a really cool concept.

A song like 'Daredevil' is built on a simple beat that sounds like someone fast clapping and then throughout the song there are new elements added that sound natural as the lyrics grow more and more powerful.

My favorite song, "Hot Knife" does a similar process with a driving "drum" pattern, but it truelly sounds like someone is hitting a hollow oil drum. As the song goes along the vocals build upon build and layer and the rest of the song adds these weird sounds that build and cresendo in an interesting arangement.

I think where I have to say that
