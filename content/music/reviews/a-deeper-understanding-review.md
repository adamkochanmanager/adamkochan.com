I'm really in between two minds on this album, the musicality is actually some of the best I have heard. ever. But, when the focus is on the lyrics, there leaves a lot to be desired. 

Lets talk about this sound though. I mean.... Holy Shit... this album sounds gorgeous. Multiple times in the first 4 songs I was just muttering "Oh Shit" to myself as these guitars, pianos, hell even a freaking harmonica! The instrumentation completely rule the sound scape. The outros of "Pain" and "Strangest Thing" are actually jaw dropping, please please please stop reading this review right now and just listen to those two songs, i actually mean it, I can barely put into words why these work so well, other than the fact I felt completely enveloped by these songs.

Ok are you back, do you see what I am talking about?!?!??! I mean gosh, its just criminal that such basic lyrics and lack of substance I felt from Adam Granduciel (the Lead Vocalist). As an "instrument", the vocals sound just as good as the rest of the album, so well mixed, so punchy when they need to be.... but what he is talking about and saying, leaves a lot to be desired. It does actually seem like he just took "lyrics about nature" and "lyrics about love" and just went with his first draft on some of these songs.

When the spotlight steps away from said lyrics and the band just lets the instrumentation do its thing, it so powerful. This is seriously up there with "To Pimp a Butterfly" and "Random Access Memories" from a production point of view. Adam Granduciel is also the producer and every single choice he made from behind the board is KILLER. He definitely made choices in front of the mic.
