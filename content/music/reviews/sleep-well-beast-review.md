Not feeling "in the mood" for this one. On the surface this is a very well-produced and sounding album, but the album stays grounded in one sound for the entire album that by the end you feel a little more defeated and a little sadder and if that is the vibe that you are looking for this is a GREAT album for you.

The album sounds at its best when it adds great instrumentation along with a little more upbeat punk sound, "Turtleneck" is the song that sticks out to me that has a lot of personality to it, with guitars popping up on the track and trading "licks" back and forth while there is a great driving beat behind the whole song.

But after this song, we fall back into the same "grey", "gloomy" sound which in some songs absolutely works, but when it’s the driving force of the entire hour long album, it does get on your nerves or at least my nerves.

Songs like 'Empire Line' and 'Guilty Party' did stand out to me from this "sound". 'Empire Line' in particular with the shifting beat in the back ground somehow gives me imagery of taking and a subway in New York City which is really really impressive. It even has moments where it sounds like a train coming to a stop. All while the lyrics detail a long-distance relationship assumedly where the only way the couple can see each other is through a train. It’s a great song that feels like it has meaning and connected to me, much more than other songs on this album.

Past that, I just don’t think this album was for the mood that I am in right now. Maybe when I am up in NYC riding the subway after a break up and listen to this album it will just "click", until that time, it’s an album I will probably never come back to.
