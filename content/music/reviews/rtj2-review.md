Run The Jewels is one of those groups that I can never believe I have never listened to before, I have heard so many great things and the times I have heard their songs I have really liked their delivery and energy. Well I’m happy to announce an entire album of that is just as good as I thought.

The energy that El-P, Killer Mike, and all the guests bring to the tracks is unmatched. From the opener “Jeopardy” to the closer “Angel Duster”, this album never takes a break. El-P and Mike bring their best for 11 tracks in a row with amazing production to match. The production matches the flows, its loud, brash and never gives you a second to breath which is great, because this album has moments where I am just left breathless.

From the alliteration on the duo verses on “Blockbuster Night, Pt. 1”, to the “Run the Jewels Fast” chopped upbeat on “Close Your Eyes”, to anytime the two MC’s pass the mic to each other in the same verse there are so many fun and memorable moments. El-P’s production is absolutely amazing, this album has “one sound/speed”, but the songs don’t sound the same but bring the same “in your face” energy.

And it isn’t all style and no substance, Killer Mike and El-P have a lot to say about system problems in our country and the culture and they don’t shy away from speaking out on these tracks. Combing these political statements with such a smart and focus flow makes it an absolute joy to see where El-P and Mike take these songs. 

I will definitely be queuing up the rest of their discography.
