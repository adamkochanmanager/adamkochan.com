If I had to describe this album in one word it would be “difficult”.

Seriously, upon first listen to this album it almost wants you to turn it off. Between the difficult instrumentation and the effects on Justin Vernon's voice (as well as the incomprehensible song titles) this album screams, "Stay away from me! I'm different!".

If you came to me and said "This album is what an AI came up with after listening to 500 different albums of all different genres" I would 100% believe you.

If you came to me and said “Here is a singer song writer album, but it got corrupted as it was uploaded to Spotify” I would 100% believe you.

But when you meet this album halfway you get some the most poignant song writing mixed with some of craziest, awes-inspiring instrumentation. The processor these songs are put through is doing the heavy lifting. The distortion sounds so wrong, but then makes this beautiful piece oif music that if this album was just played “normally” I don’t think it would feel any where close to the same.

These songs are set up in such a way that keep you guessing and sound nothing like the "singer song writer" stick that I thought Bon Iver was going to be. And the album takes so many twists and turns that you are just along for the ride waiting to see what crazy stuff Justin does next. This weird blend of singer song writer and experimental things such a great groove, that for most of the album, even know I had no idea what the hell I was listening to, I know I was enjoying it.

There are a few parts on this album that even I can admit are way more “abrasive” than “artistic”, the outro on “21 M<><>N WATER” (yes that’s the actual song title) seriously sounded like my computer was gonna blue screen of death. But compare that to a magical song like “00000 Million” which has its instrumentation barely messed with, but there is so much layering and autotune on Justin’s voice where it sounds like a whole choir of Justin’s are singing this song giving it so much more power. This might be the first album I can for sure see people hating, but man was this an absolutely amazing experience.
