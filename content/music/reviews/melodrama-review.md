Ok Lorde, I’m sorry that’s on me, here I was thinking you were a 1-hit wonder and I hated that hit (Royals is Overhyped, fite me), this album showed me I was completely wrong. Lorde please accept my apology below.

Let me get my only criticism out of the way first, This might be a hot take….. Lorde’s voice….. is just “good” it never blew me away, I was way more impressed with how it was layered and mixed rather than her voice. When you strip away all the “production” her voice is still solid but doesn’t WOW me.

But Speaking of that layer and mixing…. The production of this album, THE PRODUCTION OF THIS ALBUM

Let me just gush about how many amazing sounding moments are on here:
-	Homemade Dynamite the CRISPNESS of the “d-d-d-dynamite”
-	The “Build up” on Green Light into the chorus, into the release of “I’VE WAITED FOR IT THAT GREEN LIGHT”
-	How ‘hectic’ the end of “The Louvre” sounds and then it just all falls away and all that’s left is this guitar in this sonic space and then even that falls away
-	In “Liability”, the wandering piano absolutely stole the show
-	The Layering of Lorde’s Vocals on “Hard Feelings”

I could gush about any of the above for hours. And I will probably pick up so many more on relistens. 

I mean as a self titled “Jack Antonoff Stan” this album/these songs were pure “heroine” he really did this album justice. The instrumentation and arrangement on all of these songs deserves to be commended and I can pick up how his style has grown and changed with his future project and collaborations.

The last thing I will mention is how Lorde does an amazing job at distilling these complex emotional of growing up in your twenties, and boils them down to such BOPS. Whether its her lamenting about her own self worth on a song like “Liability” (which has just some absolutely heart breaking lyrics that I did NOT need to be relating to this hard), to “Green Light” where she is calling out to look to move on and  looking to move on and live her life after experience heartbreak. To hear this range and these stories from a (*looks up her age at the time of recording*) 20 (!!!) year old is a testament to her as an artist. 

Overall, a killer Pop album, I can see why it has such a following, and again im so happy this wasn’t “here is 10 more songs that sound like Royals”
