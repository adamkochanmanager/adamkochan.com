Featuring another band that probably needs no introduction, today was Weezer’s – Weezer (The White Album). Another band I have never really given a full album listen to. I have only known Weezer as that “dorky, but kinda cool” that people either love or hate. So given a full album a listen left me with….. mixed thoughts. 

1st lets start off with the longevity, this is Weezer’s 11th album, which is impressive that they still have some bops/grooves in them. I loved the pop punk energy of this album a long with Rivers Cuemo’s voice which sounds just as distinct as the band’s past hits. The Guitar and Drums absolutely stood out on this album making each song sound full and lively. There is also a twinge of “beach rock” layered throughout These songs really do feel like they were made to be listened while driving down Highway 101 or hanging out around a fire at the beach.

My two favorite songs of the albums were two ballads, “Endless Bummer” and “(Girl We Got A) Good Thing)”. “Endless Bummer” especially, which starts soft and slowly throughout the song it builds to an absolute bombastic ending where the drums and guitar both take times stealing the spot light.

The main drawback would have to be the lyrical content which ranges from “pretty decent” to “oh that’s cringe”.

My “favorite” is from “That God for Girls” which has a great instrument track but starts out with this gem:

> The girl in the pastry shop with the net in her
> Hair is making a cannoli for you to
> Take on your hiking trip in the woods

So overall a great sounding album that is bogged down by some pretty mediocre lyrics!
