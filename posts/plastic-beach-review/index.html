<p>I can tell you that Gorillaz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Plastic Beach&rdquo; is a great album. It has a ton of different musical ideas and passages that are so interesting and sounds amazing in the context of this album. But the lyrics and &ldquo;flow&rdquo; of the album just didn’t hit me the right way.</p>
<p>Let me try and explain.</p>
<p>The album is masterfully made and seems to be produced in such a specific way that feels like its the exact way that Damon Albarn (creator behind Gorillaz) wanted these songs to sound. You can feel that this album is a &ldquo;perfect piece&rdquo; of eletropop and I can feel so many of the artists I listen to know coming from this sound. But the songs never stood out above and beyond.</p>
<p>I kept &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; for a big &ldquo;blow my socks off&rdquo; song that was just gonna captivate me and just absolute rock my world. But each song just flowed into each other and became one &ldquo;picture&rdquo; that I can see absolutely why someone would love this album, but the sound wasn&rsquo;t for me.</p>
<p>To talk about a positive moment was the song &ldquo;Welcome to the World of Plastic Beach&rdquo; which has this sheen to it that felt like you were getting taken into this vibey, hazy world. Almost like Alice falling into Wonderland. The songs horns give this sense of a movie panning down to show the world that you are gonna spend your next 2 hours in. Then Snoop comes in and gives a theme song on top of this music and it works SO well.</p>
<p>But the next 53 minutes make me miss that exact feeling, it’s like I went into this world and what I was really looking for was the theme song on repeat.</p>
