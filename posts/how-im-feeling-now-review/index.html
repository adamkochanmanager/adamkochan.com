<hr>
<p>Coming into this album I thought I knew two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn’t like any hyperpop song</li>
<li>Charli XCX was a one hit wonder from &ldquo;Boom Clap&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>I am happy to report I was wrong on both things. &ldquo;how i&rsquo;m feeling now&rdquo; is the 2020 release of pop star Charli XCX. I had heard good things in the past of her last albums &ldquo;Pop 2&rdquo; (2017) and &ldquo;Charli&rdquo; (2019), but have never given a full album a chance until now. And I a very happy that I gave it a chance.</p>
<p>This album is full in on the hyperpop sound but isn&rsquo;t dialed up to 11 as an &ldquo;100 gecs&rdquo; album is, this album spends time with processed instrumentals and chiptune vocals, but given some space to breathe and sound like a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; pop album. I will admit that the songs that only have slight hyperpop influence were a more enjoyable experience, but the hyperpop sound didn’t push me away as much in other artists.</p>
<p>The other thing to talk about is Charlie&rsquo;s impressive song writing. This album was written and produced at the start of the COVID pandemic and there are a lot of songs that talk about missing human connection and missing parties, hell the song &ldquo;anthems&rdquo; is a club banger about missing club bangers. Other songs like &ldquo;forever&rdquo; and &ldquo;c2.0&rdquo; have very clear ties to the hyperpop sound but paired with smarter production and a more palatable sound come across as highlights for me. Especially love the chopped up vocals on &ldquo;c2.0&rdquo; that turn into the backing beat for the second half of the song.</p>
<p>The albums low lights like I said above is when the hyperpopness cup runneth over. &ldquo;pink diamond&rdquo; is a good song, but has a grating instrumental behind it that actually sounds like, that gets annoying after the first 2 minutes.</p>
<p>This was a very surprising album for me and made me appreciate Charli and hyperpop a decent amount more, but I still don&rsquo;t think I’m ready for &ldquo;stupid horse&rdquo; levels of hyperpop.</p>
