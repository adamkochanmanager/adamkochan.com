<hr>
<p>Over the past year I have been exposed to KPop (partially against my own will) and have really began to enjoy it, please come to my DM&rsquo;s and talk about TWICE. And if you are talking about KPop at some point you gotta talk about BTS.</p>
<p>The Boyband Super Group consisting of 7 <em>Wangjanims</em> Jin, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, Jungkook, and Suga (best boy). And this group expands the full pop soundscape, coming at you with upbeat rap songs, ballads, and absolute bangers.</p>
<p>To be quite honest, I had never given a full album of BTS a chance, my only exposure has been either through their &ldquo;Mainstream&rdquo; hits like &ldquo;Dynamite&rdquo;, &ldquo;Butter&rdquo;, &ldquo;Permission to Dance (Instrumental Version)&rdquo; or deep cut recommendations (check out &ldquo;Stigma&rdquo;) so this was a interesting view to see their &ldquo;deeper cuts&rdquo; and I was absolutely blown away.</p>
<p>1st off this album has a little something for everyone.</p>
<p>Looking for Bangers: Dope, Silver Spoon
Looking for Jams: Ma City, House of Cards
Looking for Bops: Run, I Need U</p>
<p>The production on this album spans so many different styles but throughout out it pulls great from its Western Rap/Pop influences. Songs on here fell so alive and upbeat and just overall &ldquo;fun&rdquo;. House of Cards felt like it could fit right along side any number of Weeknd&rsquo;s hits, while Silver Spoon and Dope feel like they can go along side some of Brockhampton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Boyband&rdquo; style Rap.</p>
<p>Speaking of &ldquo;Dope&rdquo; it is absolutely the standout track for me, an absolute Banger which has a killer Sax and has so much cockiness and braggadocios energy as they just singing about how &ldquo;Dope&rdquo; they are. It has my favorite troupe of KPop Bands where they trade off the same verse, going from one interesting flow to another. This song has an infectious &ldquo;Energy Energy Energy&rdquo; and will have you bopping you head throughout.</p>
<p>I really do hate the criticism or the stigma of &ldquo;well if i don&rsquo;t know what they say, I won&rsquo;t enjoy the songs.&rdquo; This album has so many songs where the vocal performance stands out and hits the exact energy that they are going for, where on Butterfly you get a slowed down ballad or the &ldquo;layering&rdquo; of the vocals on &ldquo;Epilogue: Young Forever&rdquo; which give it this beautiful grandiose feeling.</p>
<p>If you are looking to get into KPop or looking for a place to start your &ldquo;army&rdquo; fandom, this is a great album with a ton of standout tracks that really play up to BTS&rsquo;s strengths.</p>
