<p>Go listen to Dance Yself Clean.</p>
<p>That could be the album review and I feel that would get 95% of my point across.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna gush about that song a little more later. But this is the first album from an artist that I have a lot of sentimental love for. From &ldquo;Dance Yrself Clean&rdquo; to &ldquo;All My Friends&rdquo; to &ldquo;New York I Love You, But You Are Bring Me Down&rdquo;, this has been an artist whose bops bop. Big shout out to Matt Clementsen for showing me them in my Senior Year of College.</p>
<p>So how do I like the first full length album from LCD Soundsystem a band I have referenced before in past reviews. It was&mldr;.. good&mldr;. for sure, but maybe I just expected an entire album of S-tier bangers like the three songs mentioned above and what I got was a solid album, BUT nothing that can reach the hype of those tracks.</p>
<p>And that’s a 100% a me thing. There is a lot of different ideas on this album from a the &ldquo;dancey but punky&rdquo; &ldquo;Dance Yrself Clean&rdquo; to the &ldquo;pop rocky, Weezer sounding&rdquo; Drunk Girls (Similar song title to huh?). That’s not to say there aren&rsquo;t other good sonngs this album. &ldquo;You Wanted a Hit&rdquo; has the same build and pay off structure as &ldquo;Dance Yrself Clean&rdquo; and has some driving synths during the buildup. Which peaks with a weird but cool Guitar and &ldquo;8-Bit&rdquo; Chip tune death sound.</p>
<p>There are def misses to me on this album, &ldquo;Drunk Girls&rdquo; and &ldquo;One Touch&rdquo; which I can tell are pulling and love letters to 70/80&rsquo;s rock music but they just don&rsquo;t stick with me because that wasn&rsquo;t music that I listened to till much later in my life. So that &ldquo;nostalgia factor&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t hit as much for me.</p>
<p>But ok,. have me made it far enough, let me just talk about Dance Yrself Clean for a while. This song is a whole journey that I just desperately want to see live. The initial part of the song with the slow, somber almost &ldquo;flat&rdquo; Vocal performance which lulls you into this sense of &ldquo;comfort&rdquo;. You think the song is just going to stay at this level as it goes into its next verse which is more the same. This is still a good song, but you just feel like it is missing something. Where they add these synths and the song &ldquo;fake picks up&rdquo; for a second and then you go back to the &ldquo;somber lull&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to click skip and move to the next song, but just wait, just hold, the next time they do the synths you think its more of the same, then OUT OF NO WHERE bombastic synths and a driving drum line fill up the song, and the boring vocal performance adds all this life and you Juut want to start jumping along with the crowd. This is an absolute crowd banger and would be such a treat to see live, that payoff would be immaculate.</p>
