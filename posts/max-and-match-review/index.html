<p>Well that was such an enjoyable, short, concise album.</p>
<p>This being a subgroup of Loona a band I already like (go listen to &lsquo;Star&rsquo;) allowed me to spend the album getting to know these three voices in particular. Kim Lip, JinSoul and Choerry all kill it and their voices sound amazing together, whether its layering or them trading off on the same song/verse. I think the voice that stands out for me the most would be JinSoul, who mixes great on both ballads and the more rap parts as well.</p>
<p>This album sounds amazing, and every song seems to touch on a different &ldquo;style&rdquo; of pop, you have your &ldquo;Arianna R&B&rdquo; hit in &lsquo;Chaotic&rsquo;, your &ldquo;bubblegum bop&rdquo; in &lsquo;ODD Front&rsquo; and the blend of &ldquo;pop and rap&rdquo; in &lsquo;Girl Front&rsquo;. If you are a fan of any big mainstream pop artist right now you will find a song that you will love on this album.</p>
<p>Another thing I loved was the two different versions of &lsquo;Front&rsquo;. Where the &lsquo;Girl Front&rsquo; is bombastic and bit more upbeat, the song just seems to flow from passage to passage so seamlessly, and the chorus is absolutely killer. Then &lsquo;Odd Front&rsquo; comes a long and focus more on the vocals with a &ldquo;more laid back&rdquo; production. While the lyrics are the same between the two the difference in the styles it a treat when either of these songs come up!</p>
<p>The album is lean, but the one song that I didn’t love would probably be &lsquo;Starlight&rsquo;, a slow ballad that is a welcome change up in the upbeat pop it has been throwing at you for the past 6 songs, but it is too repetitive and &ldquo;slow&rdquo; for its own good without enough interesting production to save it.</p>
<p>I absolutely think if you have any interest in Pop music you will like this album and it’s probably my easiest album to recommend that I have listened to so far. This album is only Twenty-Five Minutes has what I would call four absolute Bops, so it’s well worth your time!</p>
