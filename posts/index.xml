Not feeling &amp;ldquo;in the mood&amp;rdquo; for this one. On the surface this is a very well-produced and sounding album, but the album stays grounded in one sound for the entire album that by the end you feel a little more defeated and a little sadder and if that is the vibe that you are looking for this is a GREAT album for you.</description></item><item><title>'Max &amp; Match' - Loona (Odd Eye Circle)</title><link>https://www.adamkochan.com/posts/max-and-match-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adamkochan.com/posts/max-and-match-review/</guid><description>If you wanna go back to the January 2022 Hub click here.
