<p>So for some back ground this is a &ldquo;different version&rdquo; of an album that came out in 2020 by the same artist, NO DREAM. So this is a passion project of Jeff&rsquo;s as he has a major love of SKA. With that in mind what does a SKA album releases in 2021 sound like?</p>
<p>It sounds absolutely amazing! Get SKA music back in the mainstream.</p>
<p>In the past few years, I have found myself adding songs like &ldquo;The Impression That I Get&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beer&rdquo; to playlists kind of as a novelty but end up always have a fun time and loving the songs, so to get a new full album of SKA bangers is just great.</p>
<p>From top to bottom this album harkens back to my days listening to &ldquo;Superman&rdquo; by Goldfinger as I stumbled my way through levels on Tony Hawk Pro Skater. The tight horns, the guitar, the keys, and background &ldquo;PICK IT UPS&rdquo; are on point for the whole run of this album.</p>
<p>There are a ton of moments where the brass section, guitars or keys just absolutely own the sound an it really took me back to my first few times I found SKA Music.</p>
<p>Where this album didn’t hit for me was on the more Reggae cuts of the album. SO I think my “wave” is the emphasis on the horns and the &ldquo;pick it ups&rdquo;. That’s my wave.</p>
<p>Will definitely have to give the album this was original based on a listen as well, but in the meantime if you want to hear some 202’s SKA doen right you will not be disappointed with this album.</p>
