<hr>
<p>Not feeling &ldquo;in the mood&rdquo; for this one. On the surface this is a very well-produced and sounding album, but the album stays grounded in one sound for the entire album that by the end you feel a little more defeated and a little sadder and if that is the vibe that you are looking for this is a GREAT album for you.</p>
<p>The album sounds at its best when it adds great instrumentation along with a little more upbeat punk sound, &ldquo;Turtleneck&rdquo; is the song that sticks out to me that has a lot of personality to it, with guitars popping up on the track and trading &ldquo;licks&rdquo; back and forth while there is a great driving beat behind the whole song.</p>
<p>But after this song, we fall back into the same &ldquo;grey&rdquo;, &ldquo;gloomy&rdquo; sound which in some songs absolutely works, but when it’s the driving force of the entire hour long album, it does get on your nerves or at least my nerves.</p>
<p>Songs like &lsquo;Empire Line&rsquo; and &lsquo;Guilty Party&rsquo; did stand out to me from this &ldquo;sound&rdquo;. &lsquo;Empire Line&rsquo; in particular with the shifting beat in the back ground somehow gives me imagery of taking and a subway in New York City which is really really impressive. It even has moments where it sounds like a train coming to a stop. All while the lyrics detail a long-distance relationship assumedly where the only way the couple can see each other is through a train. It’s a great song that feels like it has meaning and connected to me, much more than other songs on this album.</p>
<p>Past that, I just don’t think this album was for the mood that I am in right now. Maybe when I am up in NYC riding the subway after a break up and listen to this album it will just &ldquo;click&rdquo;, until that time, it’s an album I will probably never come back to.</p>
